It is one of the oldest board games still played today and is widely popular, especially in East Asia. </p> <p> The game is played by two players who take turns placing black and white stones on the intersections of a gridded board. The standard Go board is 19x19 lines. The objective of the game is to control more territory on the board than the opponent by surrounding empty intersections and capturing the opponent's stones. </p> <p> The rules of Go are deceptively simple, but the game itself is highly complex, and the strategic possibilities are virtually limitless. Unlike chess, where the number of pieces decreases over the course of the game, Go begins with an empty board, and the number of pieces increases as the game progresses. </p> <p> Go is renowned for its depth, subtlety, and strategic complexity. The large branching factor of possible moves in Go makes it a challenging game for artificial intelligence to master. Traditionally, the strategic aspects of Go were considered to be beyond the reach of computer programs. However, the development of AlphaGo by DeepMind demonstrated that advanced AI could achieve a superhuman level of play in Go, marking a significant milestone in the field of artificial intelligence and game-playing algorithms. </p> </div> <center> <img src="https://news.cgtn.com/news/3d41444e35597a4d7a41544f786b444e7a417a4e31457a6333566d54/img/fa218c4dc94f43138c9a19eed0f28cc0/fa218c4dc94f43138c9a19eed0f28cc0.jpg" alt="" style="width:350px; height:300px;"> </center> <h2 id="lee-sedol">Lee Sedol</h2> <div style="text-align: justify;"> <p> Lee Sedol was born on March 2, 1983, in Seoul, South Korea. He began playing Go at a young age, displaying exceptional talent and dedication to the game. Lee quickly rose through the ranks of the professional Go world in South Korea. </p> <p> In 2002, at the age of 19, Lee Sedol became the youngest player to reach 9-dan, the highest level in the professional Go ranking system. This accomplishment highlighted his prodigious skill and marked the beginning of what would become a highly successful career. </p> <p> Over the years, Lee Sedol secured numerous tournament victories and prestigious titles, establishing himself as one of the top Go players in the world. His aggressive and creative style of play, combined with a deep understanding of the game, earned him a reputation as one of the most formidable and entertaining Go players. </p> </div> <center> <img src="https://hoydia.com.ar/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rodriguezpag9web.jpg" alt="" style="width:320px; height:190px;"> </center> <h2 id="the-match">The match</h2> <div style="text-align: justify;"> <p>In the spring of 2016, the world witnessed a historic clash that transcended the boundaries of human intellect and artificial intelligence. The stage was set for an epic confrontation between Lee Sedol, a revered master of the ancient game of Go, and AlphaGo, an enigmatic creation of DeepMind, an artificial intelligence powerhouse.</p> <p>As the first game unfolded, the Go board became a battleground of wits. AlphaGo's moves, unconventional and unfathomable, left spectators and experts alike in awe. Lee Sedol, renowned for his strategic brilliance, found himself facing a formidable opponent that seemed to possess an uncanny understanding of the game's intricacies.</p> <p>The tension mounted with each stone placed on the board. AlphaGo claimed victory in the first, then the second, and the third game. The Go community and the world at large were captivated by the prowess of this artificial mind. Yet, amidst the growing realization that artificial intelligence was rewriting the rules, there remained a flicker of hope — the indomitable spirit of a human Go champion.</p> <p>In a stunning turn of events, Lee Sedol rallied in the fourth game. With resilience and strategic finesse, he demonstrated the depth of human intuition, dealing AlphaGo a rare defeat. The Go world erupted in applause, celebrating a moment of triumph against the seemingly invincible machine.</p> <p>But the saga was not over. The fifth and final game loomed, a decisive moment for both man and machine. AlphaGo, unyielding and relentless, secured the series with a victory in the last game. The world watched as the ancient game bowed to the emergence of a new era, where artificial intelligence had not only learned to play Go but had mastered it.</p> <p>In the aftermath, the match left an indelible mark on the landscape of artificial intelligence. Lee Sedol, with grace and humility, acknowledged the significance of the moment. The narrative had shifted, and the fusion of human ingenuity and machine intelligence had become a reality, leaving the world to ponder the implications of a future where the lines between human and artificial brilliance continued to blur. The clash between Lee Sedol and AlphaGo stood as a testament to the relentless march of progress, inviting contemplation on the co-evolution of man and machine in the boundless realms of knowledge and strategy.</p> </div> <h2 id="my-opinion">My opinion</h2> <div style="text-align: justify;"> <p>This was the first movie that got me interested in data science, even if I was rooting for Lee Sedol, and the documentary almost got me into tears at the moment Lee Sedol wins the fourth game, I got really excited about the idea of applying maths, and programming techniques to create this powerful tools, and continue working every day trying to make them better. </p> <p> I started thinking about other applications of data science and I eventually got myself learning Python. I saw myself creating these models instead of the Physics academic work. I decided to apply to the BS in Data Science at ITAM and with a bit of luck, I got myself a chance to start my path in the machine learning and artifial intelligence path. </p> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2023 Gerardo A.
